# CodeCrafters Challenge Language Support

This document provides an overview of the supported languages and their respective version support for various challenges from [CodeCrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io/). Currently, this README details support for all the languages we support.
For every language we have a table listing the challenges which are supported for the given challenge, it's current release cycle, release date, and the release cycle we support.
The support status is also mentioned for each challenge, which can be one of the following:
- ✅: We support the latest release_cycle of the language.
- ⚠️: We are behind the latest release_cycle of the language, by > 2 weeks.
- ❗: We are behind the latest release_cycle of the language, by > 3 months.
- ❌: The challenge doesn't support this language.
